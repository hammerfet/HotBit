# STM32L051xx_CUBELIB 
STMCube is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers life by reducing development efforts, time and cost. STM32Cube covers STM32 portfolio. 

STM32Cube Version 1.x includes:
The STM32CubeMX, a graphical software configuration tool that allows to generate C initialization code using graphical wizards.
A comprehensive embedded software platform, delivered per series (such as STM32CubeL0 for STM32L0 series)
The STM32Cube HAL, an STM32 abstraction layer embedded software, ensuring maximized portability across STM32 portfolio
A consistent set of middleware components such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, STM32_TouchSensing_Library
All embedded software utilities come with a full set of examples.
The STM32Cube firmware solution offers a straightforward API with a modular architecture, making it simple to fine tune custom applications and scalable to fit most requirements
     
The HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers provided within this package supports the following STM32L051xx,  STM32L052xx, STM32L053xx, STM32L062xx and STM32L063xx Series.
The STM32CubeL0 firmware package comes with an updater utility, STM32CubeUpdater, that can be configured for automatic or on-demand checks for new firmware package updates (new releases or/and patches).
For quick getting started with the STM32CubeL0 firmware package, refer to UM1745 and you can download firmware updates and all the latest documentation from www.st.com/stm32cube
